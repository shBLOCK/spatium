## ⚙️Main features
- **Fast** Pure Cython Implementation
  - ~***16x*** faster than pure python(3.12) implementation
- Spatial Math
  - [Vector](https://github.com/shBLOCK/spatium/wiki#vectors)
    - Operators +, -, *, /, @(dot), ^(cross), |(distance) ...
    - Fast (compile-time) swizzling (e.g. `Vec3(1, 2, 3).zxy`)
    - Flexible constructor (e.g. `Vec3(Vec2(1, 2), 3)`)
    - Iterating and unpacking (e.g. `x, y, z = Vec3(1, 2, 3)`)
    - Works with other libraries (pygame, numpy, ...)
  - Transform
    - [Transform2D](https://github.com/shBLOCK/spatium/wiki#transform2d) & [Transform3D](https://github.com/shBLOCK/spatium/wiki#transform3d)
  - Double-precision floats
- Pythonic & GLSL-like interface
- Custom code generation
  - IDE-friendly stubs

## 🔧Implementation details
- **Codegen!**  
  Custom code generation is used throughout this library.<br>
  Every swizzle pattern and constructor are implemented as individual methods and properties (For performance reasons).<br>
  As a result, code generation is required so that I don't have to maintain 50,000+ lines of code by hand...<br>
  Besides, it also handles vector classes of every dimension and type (e.g. Vec2 Vec3 Vec2i Vec3i) are generated from the same template, so a lot of repetitive code is avoided.<br>
  There's also a stub generator that generates stub files from the cython code generated by codegen.

## Credits
- This library is partially inspired by [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s math library.

## Notes
- This library was originally named GdMath, as I originally used this to bridge Python and Godot and focus on gamedev.
<br>
As development went on,
I realized that it has become a versatile spatial math library which is also one of the fastest,
I also found it useful in many projects.
<br>
Thus, I've decided to rename it to Spatium (since Spatial was taken), before it (possibly) gets used by more people.
